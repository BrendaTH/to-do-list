## To Do List Operation
This is a simple to-do list generator. It was built during week4 of the coding boot-camp.

Enter items that need to be done in the input box, followed by the return/enter key.
As each item is entered it is listed along with a radio button below the input box.

To indicate an item is completed check the radio button next to the item. 
The radio button will turn to a blue checkbox to indicate the item has been completed.


## Buttons
The following buttons are found at the bottom of the page:
* **all**       Display all items 
* **active**    Display active items only
* **completed** Display completed items only

When there are completed items in the list a **Clear Completed** button appears.
This allows the user to clear all the comleted items from the list. When there are no longer any
completed items in the list the **Clear Completed** button disappears.

## Future Enhancements
* The radio buttons need to be larger for operation on phone size screens
* For persistence the list should be saved in Firebase. Currently screen refresh causes the list to be lost
